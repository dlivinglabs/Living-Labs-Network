# About
Living Labs Network and Forum is a network of transdisciplinary practitioners united in their curiousity, compassion and creativity towards/in the [[Dakkhani Region]].
The network works in a number of different areas, by practicing place-basedness as a lens to frame their work. This place-basedness or situatedness is a conscious practice that seeks to study the inheritances and possibilities of a place and work with what is already there. 
Through this study, we seek to bring forth alternative modes of development that are highly specific, localised and contextual. The way we co-produce these alternative visions is through a practice of care-full creative engagement with various [[Living Labs Network#Micro-Contexts | micro-contexts]]. 

# [[List of Micro-Contexts| Micro-Contexts]]
These are smaller worlds of study that we have engaged in. These micro-contexts might be places, people, cultural practices, biomes, organising structure, governance systems, topography occupations, languages, artforms and more. The idea is to start small in any place that we engage in and collectively form and shape new ways of development through care-full collaboration and creative practice.
